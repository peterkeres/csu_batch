this will hold an example file that will get run by the exevpe systme call
this is a stand in for batch files, should work the same ether way

 could have other example files, maybe put a forloop in them so they take awahile to run

 NOTE: make sure you compile this file before you try to call it with the execv function

int main (int argc, char *args[]){

  puts("the example_batch fiel was run! sweet\n");

  return 0;
